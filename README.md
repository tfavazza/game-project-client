This app uses JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, and bootstrap. It was built in a week,
using wireframes and user stories to help guide its creation.

My original plan was to include online cross-computer two player mode, but the
time constraints didn't allow for it. My final project ended up looking a lot
different from my [wireframe](http://imgur.com/a/OycBH) model, but I'm still
happy with what I accomplished in the short time I had.

Future versions:
  -online two player
  -better UI
